Algorithm to check wheather it is a perfect number or not 
step 1: start
step 2: declare a variable i ,n and sum 
step 3: assign the values  into i=1 and sum=0 and n=6
step 4: check the condition i value is less than n (i<n) otherwise go to step 10 
step 4: check the conditon if(n%i)==0  then go to step 5  otherwise go to step 6
step 5 : then sum =sum +i
 step6: increment i value by 1(i=i+1)
step 7: repeat the steps 4,5,6, until  the condition is true otherwise go to step 10 
step 8 :check that sum==n if is true 7 otherwise go to step 8
step 7 : then print 6 is perfect number 
step 8: print not perfect
step 10: stop


Algorthim for the basic salary of employee
    WAP to input basic salary of an employee and calculate its Gross     salary according to following:
    Basic Salary <= 10000 : HRA = 20%, DA = 80%
    Basic Salary <= 20000 : HRA = 25%, DA = 90%
    Basic Salary > 20000 : HRA = 30%, DA = 95%


step1: start
step2: decalre the variable basic salary, gross salary,HRA,DA
step3: read the basic salary
step4: if the basic salary was less than or equal to 10000
step5: calculate the 20%HRA(basic salary*20/100) and 80%DA( basic salary*80/100)
step6: for calculate gross salary add basic salary+HRA+DA & then go to step 13
step7: else if basic salary was less than or equal to 20000
step8:calculate the 25%HRA(basic salary*25/100) and 90%DA( basic salary*90/100)
step9: for calculate gross salary add basic salary+HRA+DA & then go to step13
step10:else if basic salary was greater than 20000
step 11:calculate the 30%HRA(basic salary*30/100) and 95%DA( basic salary*95/100)
step12: for calculate gross salary add basic salary+HRA+DA and then go to step13
step13: print gross salary
step14:stop

step15:go to step16
step16: print gross salary
step17:stop

Algorithm to Write a program that prompts the user to enter their weight in pounds and their height in inches, and then calculates their body mass index (BMI). The program should then output whether they are underweight, normal weight, overweight, or obese based on their BMI.
 
step

step1: start
step2: declare the variables height,weight,BMI
step3: read the values of height,weight
step4: caculate the BMI by weight/(square of (height))
step5: if BMI is less than or equal to 18.5
step6: print the person is under weight
step7: else if the BMI is less than or equal to 24.9
step8: print the person is normal weight
step9: else if the BMI is greater or equal to 29.9
step10 print the person is overweight
step11:otherwise print obese
step12: stop


Algorithm to print the factorial of 15
step 1: start
step 2: declare a variable i, n
istep 3: assign the value i=1 ,n=15 
step 4: check  condition that the i value is less than or equal to n
step 5: if the i value is less than and equal to n then go to step 6 or otherwise go to step10
step 6: check i value is divisible by n or not 
step 7:if the i is divisible by n 
step 8: then print the value of i is a factorial of n otherwise go to step 9
step 9:increment the value of i by 1 until it satisfies the condition (i<=n)
step10 : stop
