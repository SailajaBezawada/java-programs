algorithm for positive or negative numbers
step 1: start 
step 2: declare the n
step 3 : read the value n 
step 3: if the number is >0 (n>0)
step 4 : print positive number  
step 5 : else if the number is <0(n<0)
step 6: print negative number 
 step 7 : stop 

Algorithm for greatest number between two numbers
 step 1 : start
 step 2: declare two numbers a and b
 step 3 : read the values into a and b 
 step 4: if a value is greater then b 
step 5 : display a is greater number 
step 6 : otherwise display  b is greater number
step 7: stop 


Algorithm to find the largest  number among the three numbers 
step1 : start 
step 2: declare three numbers a,b,c
step 3: read the values into a b and c
step 4: if a is greater than b and a is also greater than c 
step 5 : print a is largest number 
step 6: if b is greater than a and b is also greater than c
step 7: then print b is largest number
step 8: otherwise print c is largest number 
step 9 : stop 


Write an algorithm to input marks of five subjects Physics, Chemistry, Biology,     Mathematics and Computer. 
 step 1: start 
 step 2: declare the subjects physics,chemistry ,biology,maths and computer
step 3: read the values into physics ,chemistry,biology maths and computer
 step 4: now calculate the sum of the marks of the subjects 
step 5: and now calculate the percentage(sum of the marks /total marks)*100
step 6: if the percentage is greater than equal to 90% 
step 7 : then print grade A
step 8 : if the percentage is greater than equal to 80 %
step 9 : then print grade B
step 10 : if the percentage is greater than equal to 70%
step 11: then print grade C
step 12: if the percentage is greater than equal to 60%
step 13 : then print grade D
step 14 :if the percentage is greater than equal to 40%
step 15 : then print grade E
step 16 : if the percentage is less than 40%
step 17 : then print grade F
step 18 : stop


write an algorithm for check an alphabet is vowel or consonant
step 1: start
step 2: declare the charachter  
step 3 : read the charachter 
step 4:if the charachter  is equals to a,e,i,o,u,s 
step 5 : then print vowel 
step 6 : otherwise print consonant
step 7 : stop

algorithm to check whether he is eligible to vote 
step 1 : start 
step 2: declare the variable age 
step 3 : read the value of the variable age 
step 4: if the age is greater than are equal to 18 
step 5 : then  print he is eligible to vote
step 6: if the age is not greater than 18 
step 7: then print he is not eligible to vote 
step 8 : stop 

Algorithm  to find the sum and avg of three numbers 
step 1: start 
step 2: declare the number1,number2,number 3
step 3: read the values into number1 ,number2 ,number3
step 4: now by adding the three numbers we can  get the sum
step 5:sum=number 1+ number 2+ number 3
step 6: now print the sum
step 5:now  we calculate the avg = sum/3
step 6:display avg
step 7: stop

step 2: declare the email address or phone number ,and password 
step 3 : read the value into email adress or phone number and password 
step 4:if the email address and password is correct 
step 5: then you can login into facebook 
step 6: display login successfully 
step 7 : if your login details is incorrect 
step 8: then display invalid email address or password
step 9: stop
