Algorithm for prediction of winning  of cricket match 
step 1: start 
step 2:declare the  team 1 and team 2  
step 3: read the values into team 1 and team 2
step 4:compare the previous winning scores of both the teams
step 5: if team 1 wins 5 previous matches and team 2 wins 3 previous matches
step 6 : then display there is a possibility for team 1 to win the match 
step 7 : stop 


Algorithm to print “bitLabs” 10 times.
step 1: start 
step 2:declare the string bitlabs,n
step 3: read the value into bitlabs 
step 4: if(n>=10)
step 5: print" bitlabs 10 times"
step 6: stop 

Algorithm to print "my name is sowjanya" for 5 times.
 
o/p:
my name is sowjanya
my name is sowjanya
my name is sowjanya
my name is sowjanya
my name is sowjanya
 
looping - for, while , do while
 
step1:start
step2:declare count
step3:assigning the value 1 to count variable (count=1)
step4:print "myname is sowjanya"
step5:incrementing count value by 1 and store the value into count (count =count+1)
step6: repeat step 4 and 5 until it reaches count value is greater than 5 (count<=5)
step7:stop

Algorithm to print bitlabs 10 times
 step 1 : start
step 2: declare count 
step3: assigning the value 1 to count (count=1)
step4: print " bitlabs"
step5: incrementing count value by 1 and store tha value into count (count =count+1)
step 6: repeat step 4 and step 5 until it reaches count value is greater than 10 (count<=10)
step 7 : stop

if we start with 1 (1<=10) if we want to print 10 times 
if we start with 0 (1<10)if we want to print 10 times

how to write algorithm for "print 10 to 1"
Step 1: start
step 2: declare count
step 3: assigning the value 10 to count (count =10)
step 4: print count 
step 5: decrement count value by 1
step6 : store the value into count (count =count-1)
step7:repeat step 4 and 5 until it reaches count value (count>=1)
step 8 : stop
Assignment1
1.write algorithm for sum of 1 to 10 numbers.
2.write algorithm for print even numbers from 1 to 100
3.write algorithm for print odd numbers from 1 to 100


1.write algorithm for sum of 1 to 10 numbers.
step1: start
step2: declare count,sum
step3: Assigning the value 1 into count and assigning value '0' to sum
step4: adding count value to sum and store that result into sum (sum-->sum+count)
step5: increment the count value by 1 (count-->count+1)
step6: repeat these step 4 and step 5 until it reaches the count value lessthan or equal to 10
       (count<=10) otherwise go to step7
step7: print sum
step8: stop

2.write algorithm for print even numbers from 1 to 100
step1:start
step2:declare count variable
step3:assigning the value 1 into count
step4:check if the count value is divisible by 2 or not(count%2==0). if it is divisible by 2 goto step5 otherwise goto step6
step5:print count
step6:increment the count value by 1 (count=count+1)
step7:repeat the step 4,5,6 until it reaches the count value lessthan or equal to 100 (count<=100)
step8:stop
 


Algorithm for the sum of even number upto 20
step 1: start
step 2: decalre the  variable i and sum
step 3:assign the value 1 to i and 0 to sum i.e i=1 and sum=0
step 4: if i%2==0 then go to step 5 otherwise go to step 6
step 5 : print sum
step 6 :increment the sum value by (sum=sum+i)
step 7 : repeat the step4 until it reaches the condition(i<=20)
step 8 : stop 



Algorithm for the print odd numbers from 1 to 100
step 1: start
step2:declare the variable i
step 3:read tha value 1 into i
step 4:increment the value i by 1 and store the i value into i (i=i+1)
step 5: repeat the step 4&5 until i value is greater than 100 (i<=100)
step6:then i%2!=0 
step 7 : and then print the i value 
step 8 : now the add 1 to the final i value i.e(i=i+1)
step 9: display the i value 
step 10 : stop
